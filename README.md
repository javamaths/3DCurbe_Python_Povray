# 3DCurbe_Python_Povray

I created a povray sheet that draw nice images of parametric curves.
It would be nice to now have a small python program (wrapper) in order to easily modify the parameters of the povray sheet.
One could thus immediately see the result in the program python.
But I can not.
I have been testing with the command line windows but I can not.
